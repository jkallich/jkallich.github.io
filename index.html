    <h1>Jahnavi Kallichanda</h1>
    <h2>Aspiring Computer Scientist and Artist</h2>

    <div class = "UnderStuff">
      <p class = "bruh">Hello! I’m Jahnavi, a first-year college student and artist. Having been exposed to computer science (CS) before my freshman year of high school, I’ve dedicated the past four years to CS, both in and out of school, and am excited to get my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science in college. I am also an artist, taking interest mostly in pen, pencil, and watercolor mediums. While I specialize in doodling across any possible surface of paper I can find, I hope that one day, I can make art for people other than myself, with a webcomic, graphic novel, or social media platform. In my spare time, I also love reading, the outdoors, and cracking as many bad puns I can! </p> <br/>
      <p>Feel free to explore more about me below!</p><br/><br/>
